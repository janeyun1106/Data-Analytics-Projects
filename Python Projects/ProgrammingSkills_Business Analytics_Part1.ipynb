    "## Instructions - Please read carefully before starting\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Submitting your completed work:** Please complete the exam in this notebook itself and upload a copy to the Canvas dropbox. The dropbox will automatically close at the scheduled exam end time so you must upload the completed notebook before the dropbox closes. Once you have uploaded the file, please download it from Canvas and confirm that it uploaded correctly. If you have issues, please do ALL of the following: (1) alert the proctor for help, (2) email a copy to me via Canvas and (3) leave your notebook on the notebook server (don't open, edit or change it to keep the original timestamp).\n",
    "   \n",
    "<BR/>\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Resources that you can use:** The exam is open notes, open book, open reference (Python Documentation and the two textbooks used as references) and closed resources. This means that you can refer to any material that I have provided, any notebooks and notes that you created, the [python reference site](https://docs.python.org/3/), the [python tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3.9/tutorial/index.html), the [Think Python](https://go.oreilly.com/pennsylvania-state-university/library/view/-/9781491939406/?ar) and [Python Crash Course](https://go.oreilly.com/pennsylvania-state-university/library/view/-/9781492071266/?ar) textbooks during the exam. However, you may not access any other websites or receive help from other sources or individuals.\n",
    "\n",
    "<BR/>\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **How to answer questions:** If a question contains a blank code cell, write your own code to answer the question. If a question includes a code cell with some code in it, you need to add and/or modify lines of code to achieve the desired result (in some cases you will see blanks ____ which you should replace with appropriate code). Updating the code cells to follow the intended code/logic makes your answer eligible for a max of 100% of the points for the question. If you get stuck however, you can write your own code instead. That will make your answer eligible for a max of 90% of the point value for the question. Get as far as you can to retrieve/ calculate/ display quantitative information using code. Then, interpret the results and provide a final answer as needed. Be sure to explain how you arrived at the conclusion from the results of the code. \n",
    "\n",
    "<BR/>\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Copying the provided code cells and indicating which code cell should be graded:** Create a copy of the provided code cell before you start your work on a question. This way you have a copy of the original code cell to refer to. When you are done answering a question, make sure that your final answer is the first code cell below the question. ONLY THE FIRST code cell below the question will be graded (we won't choose the best of several cells) and it is your responsibility to ensure that the work you want graded is in the first code cell below a question. \n",
    "\n",
    "<BR/>\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Saving your work and troubleshooting issues with running code** Save your work frequently by clicking on the save icon on the top left of the notebook toolbar. If the server crashes you won't be able to retrieve your work, unless you saved it. If your code cell doesn't run or is stuck at the \"*\" symbol, try the following:\n",
    "    - Close all files\n",
    "    - Log out (File > Log Out)\n",
    "    - Log in and reopen the file you were working on. Wait for the bottom status bar to show \"Python (ipykernel) | Idle\". When it does, run the code cell again.\n",
    "    - If you don't see the \"Idle\" status or your code does not still run, restart your server using File > Hub Control Panel. Make sure you close the older tab after restarting the server.\n",
    "    - If you continue to have trouble with running the code, please raise your hand to get the proctor's help.\n",
    "\n",
    "<BR/>          \n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Identifying information and Honor code statement:** Please type your full name in the space provided below. Typing your name also indicates that you understand the academic integrity requirements of the exam and are certifying that you have not violated them. Violation of the academic integrity requirements will result in formal proceedings and failure in the exam and possibly the course."
